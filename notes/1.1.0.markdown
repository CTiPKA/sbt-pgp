https://github.com/sbt/sbt-pgp/compare/v1.0.1...v1.1.0-M1

### Fixes and minor enhancements

- sbt-pgp 1.1.0 is cross built for sbt 0.13 and 1.0.0. sbt 0.13 version now requires JDK7. #100 by @eed3si9n
- Use Gigahorse for HTTP client available for both 2.10 and 2.12.
- Supports `skip in publish := true`. This allows skipping publishing _without_ depending on sbt-pgp. #101 by @eed3si9n
