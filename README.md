# GPG Plugin

This plugin aims to provide GPG signing for XSBT (SBT 0.11+ versions).  The plugin currently uses the command line GPG process.  


## Usage

First, make sure GPG is installed for your platform.

### 'nix

Create a GPG key.

    gpg --gen-key

Start the GPG agent (to avoid entering your password multiple times).

### Windows

Someone who has a windows machine needs to figure this out.
